                <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
                I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the
                sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to
                smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p>
